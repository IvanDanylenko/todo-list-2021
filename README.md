# Todo List 2021

This project was created with react. It's simple todo list where you can add, edit or delete tasks.

While writing this project I used such react features like 'react hooks' (useState, useEffect, useRef) and function components.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install && npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
